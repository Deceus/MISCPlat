# MISCPlat

This was a side project from a long time ago, please try not to judge this work too harshly. I always intended to go back and clean things up after I got everything working but never got around to it. I wanted to dive into a new framework back in 2012 and Android seemed pretty promising. I wrote this application to give mobile users (including myself) visting the bodybuilding.com forums a better experience. The main features of this app are:

- Easier navigation between the "MISC" section, user control panel and Private Messaging screens
- Gave the option to embedd images using JavaScript since the default mobile experience was to place them behind a link.
- Create lists of people to "rep" or "neg", users were limited to 5 of these actions a day and requested this feature to keep track of who they wanted to rep and/or neg in the future.
- A library of common reaction images and GIFs, similar to how giphy is integrated into most common chat apps these days.
- A quick and easy way to snap a picture and share it with the forum. "Pics or negs" was a common occurence where users would have their forum reputation decimated if they couldn't provide photographic evidence to go along with their thread in a timely manner. With the MiscPlat app you could snap a picture, do an anonymous upload to imgur and get the link to the hosted image copied to your clipboard without ever leaving the website.
- Provided a quick and easy way to bookmark threads for future viewing

It was very well recieved and was even stickied by the admins to appear at the top of the forum for a few months after release. While I'm not particular proud of how a lot of things are written, I am proud to include this project into my portfolio based on what I was able to accomplish in such a short amount of time in an area I had very little experience in.
